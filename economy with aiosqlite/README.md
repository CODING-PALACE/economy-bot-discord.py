# Note: for discord.py users

If you are using discord.py then you need to make some changes in the code,
the instructions are given in comments in `main.py` file and all `*.py` files in `cogs` folder

**You can just clone [`branch:alpha`](https://github.com/Modern-Realm/economy-bot-discord.py/tree/alpha)**

```sh
git clone --single-branch -b alpha https://github.com/Modern-Realm/economy-bot-discord.py
```

**Or make some changes:**

- In `main.py`

  Make sure to uncomment the code where it has `await client.load_extension(...)`.

- In all `*.py` files in `cogs` folder

  Make sure to uncomment the code where the `setup(client)` is asynchronous

  i.e `async def setup(client)`
